# Felipe Arcidiacono – Engineering Portfolio
A curated collection of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, incident response, and real-time automation projects.

This repository highlights work across:
- SRE / Cloud Infrastructure / Distributed Systems  
- Advanced AWS  
- High-pressure debugging and incident response  
- Complex migrations  
- Real-time automation and AI  
- Teaching-level technical clarity  

These are not toy projects—they are real systems I designed, rebuilt, or rescued in production.
